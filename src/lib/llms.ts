  {
    q: "What is the difference between Direct and Tracked QR codes?",
    a: "Direct QR codes store the content in the image itself, so scanning opens it instantly with no redirect. Tracked QR codes store a short QR Anvil redirect link. The redirect lets QR Anvil count scans, record country, city, device, browser, and time, and lets the owner change the destination URL after the code is printed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is QR Anvil free?",
    a: "Yes. QR Anvil is free to use with no watermark. URL QR codes and PNG downloads work without an account. A free account unlocks all 8 QR types, SVG and PDF downloads, Tracked QR codes, and the analytics dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which download formats are available?",
    a: "PNG, SVG, and PDF. All three are generated in the browser.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where are QR codes generated?",
    a: "In the browser, using the qr-code-styling library. Direct QR content is never sent to the server. Tracked QR codes store only the destination URL and a short code on the server.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does error correction do?",
    a: "Error correction lets a QR code scan even when part of it is damaged or covered. Level L recovers 7 percent, M 15 percent, Q 25 percent, and H 30 percent of the code. Higher levels make the code denser but more robust.",
