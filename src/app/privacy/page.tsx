							1. Information We Collect
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-3">
							We collect the following types of information:
						</p>
						<ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
							<li>
								<strong>Account information:</strong> name,
								email address, and profile image provided
								through our authentication provider (Clerk) when
								you sign in with an email address or a
								third-party account.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>QR code data (signed-in users):</strong>{' '}
								the content you encode in your QR codes and the
								customization settings, stored so you can find
								and download them again in your dashboard. QR
								codes made without an account are not stored.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>
									Scan analytics (Tracked QR codes only):
								</strong>{' '}
								a truncated IP address, approximate location
								(country and city, when the network provides
								it), device type, operating system, browser,
								referrer, and timestamp of each scan.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Usage counters:</strong> an anonymous
								record of the QR code type each time a code is
								downloaded. It contains no content and no
								account identifier.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Contact messages:</strong> the subject
								and message you send through the contact form,
								together with your account name and email.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							2. How We Use Your Information
						</h2>
						<ul className="mt-3 list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
							<li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
							<li>To manage your account</li>
							<li>
								To provide scan analytics for Tracked QR codes
							</li>
							<li>
								To answer your contact messages
							</li>
							<li>
								To improve the Service and develop new features
							</li>
							<li>
								To prevent abuse and enforce our Terms of
								Service
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p className="mt-3">
							Account emails such as sign-in verification are
							sent by our authentication provider on our behalf.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							3. Direct vs Tracked QR Codes
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-3">
							<strong>Direct QR codes</strong> encode your content
							directly in the QR image. No data passes through our
							servers when these codes are scanned. We have no
							visibility into Direct QR code usage.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-3">
							<strong>Tracked QR codes</strong> redirect through
							our servers, which allows us to record scan data.
							This data is used solely to provide scan analytics to
							the QR code owner. The IP address is truncated
							before it is stored (the last part of the address is
							removed), so a scan cannot be linked to a single
							device.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							4. Data Sharing
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-3">
							We do not sell your personal information. We share
							data only with:
						</p>
						<ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
							<li>
								<strong>Service providers:</strong> Clerk
								(authentication), our hosting and database
								providers, and, when enabled, Upstash (request
								rate limiting, which processes a truncated form
								of your IP address)
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Legal requirements:</strong> when
								required by law or to protect our rights
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							5. Data Retention
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-3">
							Account data, QR codes, and scan analytics are
							retained for as long as your account exists. When you
							delete your account, your account record, your QR
							codes, their scan data, and your contact messages
							are deleted. Tracked QR codes stop working at that
							point. Anonymous usage counters contain no personal
							data and are kept.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							6. Security
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-3">
							Data is encrypted in transit (TLS). Authentication
							is handled by Clerk; we never see or store your
							password. However, no method of transmission over the
							Internet is 100% secure.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
							7. Your Rights
						</h2>

							<li>
								Access, update, or delete your account from the
								dashboard settings page
